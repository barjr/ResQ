# ResQ

ResQ is a smart alert system designed for any size event or venue. The system allows attendees to quickly request emergency help with a single tap of a button on their phone. Emergency responders and helpful bystanders receive real-time alerts that include interactive geolocation and a user provided description, along with guidance on the severity of the alert. The system improves emergency response times, enhances response coordination, and saves lives.
